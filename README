BUILDING:
	run 'make' in the root directory with the source files
	
RUNNING:
	start the server with './server <listen port> <filename>'
	the server will listen on the specified port for incoming connections, and serve the specified file to connecting clients, writing information about each packet sent to STDOUT
	run the client with './client <hostname/IP> <port>'
	the client will read data from the server at the specified host and port, and output it to STDOUT

WHAT WORKS:
	server:
		- starts up, binds to specified listening port
		- accepts incoming connections from clients
			* performs a handshake
			* makes an initial estimate of round-trip-time
		- reads file from disk
		- sends file to client at initially-calculated rate
		- receives feedback from client
		- nofeedback timer expires after 2 seconds
		- writes data about each packet sent to STDOUT
		- does not fork()-bomb machine
		
	client:
		- starts up, connects to server at specified address
			* performs a handshake
		- receives file from server
		- writes file to STDOUT
		- sends feedback packets to server
		- calculates and sends elapsed time
		- has a feedback timer
		
WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
	server:
		- does not adjust send rate based on feedback
		- does not adjust send rate based on nofeedback timeout
		- does not adjust nofeedback timeout
		
	client:
		- does not calculate loss events
		- does not calculate receive rate
